### Features
Simple website that displays information regarding Duke University's five national championship built with npx's create-react-app. The site is developed using React, React Router DOM, and Material UI.

In the second phase, a seventh page was added which displays fun facts. This is done via displaying JSON data retrived via a GET method request sent throgh axios.

To interact with the site, simply click one of the six buttons on the main page, and when finished, you may return to the main menu.

### Known Bugs
None.


### Notes
I *did* use branches when developing this project since I tried to avoid pushing to master as often as possible. However, I deleted the branches after merging them, so they are no longer public. But a quick browse into my Merge history will show that they did in fact exist with proper names! Note that in the second phase, I stopped using ead45/ in front of my names, since this felt unnecesary on a one-man project.

Additionally, I *did* push to masterâ€”but only when setting up the shell of the website and adding documentation. Once I installed all dependencies, I then switched over to using branches for development and refactoring.

Lastly, I tried (somewhat unsuccessfully) to learn how to rebase and squash commits. As such, there are a few commits (42ada506, 0a8aa116, and 66e4f759) that have poor commit messages, since I was struggling to add them in the terminal. Aside from that, though, I believe that my commits are well-named and reference issues in their descriptions.

### Impressions
Gitlab is a really useful tool! I totally would have used Issues and the Kanban board in CS308 if I knew that it were an option. I would suggest integrating this into the curriculum!
